# glitchr/omnisong

One contract for listening to a musician's catalogue - the Omnibus of records. Listening, not
publishing: where a recording is, what is on it, the previews and the players, read from the
services that know it. And the label first: a musician's site shows "released by ES-DUR, buy it
there" before "listen on Spotify".

```php
$release = $catalog->release(Reference::upc('4015372820954'), new Label('ES-DUR', 'https://www.es-dur.de'));

$release->tracks[0]->previewUrl;                 // 30 seconds, for an <audio> element
$release->links->first();                        // ES-DUR, then the streamers in order
$embedder->embed($release->links->get(Platform::SPOTIFY));   // the platform's own player
$catalog->releases('Anaëlle Tourret');           // what an artist put out, newest first
```

This package holds the contract (`CatalogInterface`, `CatalogFactory`, `Registry`), the aggregator
(`Catalog\Catalog`), the models (`Reference`, `Release`, `Track`, `Label`, `PlatformLinks`,
`Embed`...), the `Platform` enum, the `Player\Embedder` and a bridge for Symfony. It needs no
framework: it requires nothing but `symfony/http-client-contracts`, each catalogue package
`symfony/http-client`. Each catalogue is a package of its own:

| Package | Catalogue |
|---|---|
| `omnisong/odesli` | Odesli (song.link): the same song or album on every platform, by a URL or a platform's id |
| `omnisong/itunes` | The iTunes Search API: releases, their tracks and 30-second previews, an artist's albums - no key |

A reference is a URL on any platform, a UPC/EAN (a release), an ISRC (a recording) or a
platform's own id; `Reference::parse()` reads any of them from a string. A catalogue answers what
it can and throws `NotSupportedException` for the rest: `Catalog` asks every configured catalogue
in turn and merges what they say. iTunes finds the release by its UPC and gives its tracks; Odesli,
which reads no UPC, is asked again by the iTunes id and gives the other platforms. A catalogue that
is down, rate limited or refused is skipped and named in `$catalog->incomplete`: a site does not
cache that half answer.

`PlatformLinks` are in the order a site shows them (`Platform::rank()`): the label, its shop,
Bandcamp, then Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, YouTube, Deezer, Qobuz, Idagio, Tidal, Amazon
Music, then the stores. `toArray()` / `fromArray()` store them as URLs by platform.

## Plain PHP

```sh
composer require glitchr/omnisong omnisong/itunes
```

```php
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Omnisong\Catalog\Catalog;
use Omnisong\Itunes\ItunesCatalogFactory;
use Omnisong\Model\Label;
use Omnisong\Model\Reference;
use Omnisong\Registry;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$registry = new Registry([new ItunesCatalogFactory(HttpClient::create())], [
    'itunes' => ['factory' => 'itunes', 'options' => ['country' => 'de']],
]);
$catalog = new Catalog($registry->all());

$release = $catalog->release(Reference::upc('4015372820954'), new Label('ES-DUR', 'https://www.es-dur.de'));
echo $release->title, "\n";                       // Perspectives Concertantes
echo $release->tracks[0]->previewUrl, "\n";       // 30 seconds, for an <audio> element
echo $release->links->first()->url, "\n";         // https://www.es-dur.de: the label first
```

No key: the iTunes Search API is open. A factory takes the HTTP client to call with - the
application's, a `MockHttpClient` in a test - and makes its own when given none. The whole
script and its answer, and the rest: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md). No class of a
framework is loaded on the way: `Tests/BareTest.php` checks it in a process of its own, and so
does `docker compose run --rm omnisong bare`.

## The players

`Player\Embedder` turns a link into the platform's own iframe, from its public embed URL - no
key, no SDK: Spotify (albums, tracks, playlists, artists), Apple Music (albums, songs - `?i=` for
one track of an album -, playlists), Deezer (albums, tracks, playlists, artists), YouTube and
YouTube Music (through youtube-nocookie.com) and SoundCloud. Light or dark, compact or full; the
iframe is lazy and sandboxed, and `Embed::$src` names the host a Content-Security-Policy's
`frame-src` must allow.

Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer play the whole track to a listener signed in with a subscription -
a stream counted for the artist, as in their apps - and a 30-second preview to everyone else.
Load the player on a click, not with the page: it sets the platform's cookies.

## Symfony

In a Symfony application a bundle does the wiring; its components (`symfony/config`,
`symfony/dependency-injection`, `symfony/http-kernel`, `twig/twig`) are not required by this
package: the application has them ([docs/symfony.md](docs/symfony.md)).
`Omnisong\Bridge\Symfony\OmnisongBundle`: every `omnisong/*` catalogue installed registered, the
catalogues built from configuration, `CatalogInterface` autowired as the aggregator that asks them
in the configured order, each catalogue injectable by its name, the `Embedder` with the site's
theme.

```yaml
omnisong:
    catalogs:            # by name, in the order the aggregator asks them
        odesli: { factory: odesli, options: { api_key: '%env(default::ODESLI_API_KEY)%', country: 'DE' } }
        itunes: { factory: itunes, options: { country: 'de' } }
    player:
        theme: light     # light|dark, the Embedder's default
        country: ~       # overrides the store Apple Music opens
```

```php
public function __construct(CatalogInterface $catalog, EmbedderInterface $embedder) {}
public function __construct(CatalogInterface $itunes) {}   // one catalogue, by its name
```

With Twig installed, the templates have the players and the platforms' names:

```twig
{{ omnisong_embed(release.links.get(platform)) }}
{{ omnisong_embed('https://open.spotify.com/album/...', {theme: 'dark', compact: true}) }}
{{ omnisong_platform('apple_music').label }}   {{ link.platform.value|omnisong_platform_label }}
```

An application's own `CatalogFactoryInterface` is registered too (autoconfigured).

## Docker: every catalogue, for real

`docker/` runs this package with every `omnisong/*` catalogue installed - from GitHub, or from the
checkouts beside this one when `OMNISONG_PLUGINS=../..` is set - and a console that asks the real
services with the settings in `docker/.env` (copy `.env.dist`). iTunes needs no key; Odesli
refuses keyless calls (401) and is skipped, and said so, until `ODESLI_API_KEY` is set.

```sh
cd docker && cp .env.dist .env
docker compose run --rm omnisong catalogs                 # which catalogues are installed and configured
docker compose run --rm omnisong links 4015372820954 --label ES-DUR --label-url https://www.es-dur.de
docker compose run --rm omnisong release 4015372820954 --label ES-DUR --label-url https://www.es-dur.de   # JSON
docker compose run --rm omnisong releases "Brieuc Vourch" --limit 10
docker compose run --rm omnisong embed https://music.apple.com/de/album/perspectives-concertantes/1793146044 --dark
docker compose run --rm omnisong bare                     # plain PHP: no bundle, no container, and what PHP loaded
docker compose run --rm omnisong test                     # every package's tests
```
